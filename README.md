# Password-Generator

Once the user clicks the 'generate password' button, the windwow will list a series of prompts with criteria to generate their password: 
- write how many characters the desired password should be (between 8 and 128 characters);
- confirm whether or not the user wants to include numbers in their password;
- confirm whether or not the user wants to include lower case characters in their password;
- confirm whether or not the user wants to include upper case characters in their password;
- and finally confirm whether or not the user wants to include special characters in their password.

Once the user has clicked through the series of criteria prompts, the application will generate the password in the box.
